This is the project where you get in touch with the *graphic library*. Yey!  
Basically, So_Long is about you creating your first 2D game. It's supposed to be simple, though, so don't get worked up üòÅ (besides, you'll have lots of chances to go crazy making games in the future, if that's what you want haha).  
The idea is really straightforward:  
- You'll display a map with some collectables and a character on the screen  
- The character must collect all the items before leaving the map  
  
If you're new to this (as I was), you may ask: Okay, I know how to deal with I/O and to write functions at this point, but how will I deal with graphic elements?  
So here it is the awaited, the one, the only...    

## The MiniLibx (or: *getting to know the graphic library*)  

But what exactly is in between the connection with the graphic server and the function that'll loop through the code over and over to keep and update the game?  
What is in this sandwich?  
## The Part You Play (or: *your code in the loop and.. the graphic elements per se*)  
**pun not intended.. or is it?**
