This is the project where you get in touch with the *graphic library*. Yey!  
Basically, So_Long is about you creating your first 2D game. It's supposed to be simple, though, so don't get worked up üòÅ (besides, you'll have lots of chances to go crazy making games in the future, if that's what you want haha).  
The idea is really straightforward:  
- You'll display a map with some collectables and a character on the screen  
- The character must collect all the items before leaving the map  
  
Aside from the graphic elements management (which will be dealt with by the graphic library functions we have to incorporate in the program), the the code you'll actually write (a.k.a *the part you play*. Pun ~~not~~ intended) will gravitate on aspects you'll already know and came to appreciate: **parsing, storing and validating**.  
If you're new to this (as I was), you may ask: Okay, I know how to deal with I/O and to write functions at this point, but how will I deal with graphic elements?  
So here it is the awaited, the one, the only...    

## The MiniLibx (or: *getting to know the graphic library*)  

In summary, this library provides functions to open and manage windows, draw pixels, insert and destroy images and, of course, keep your program on a loop. Below, some useful links to practice and understand the MiniLibX better:
