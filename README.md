This is the project where you get in touch with the *graphic library*. Yey!  
Basically, So_Long is about you creating your first 2D game. It's supposed to be simple, though, so don't get worked up üòÅ (besides, you'll have lots of chances to go crazy making games in the future, if that's what you want haha).  
The idea is really straightforward:  
- You'll display a map with some collectables and a character on the screen  
- The character must collect all the items before leaving the map  
  
If you're new to this (as I was), you may ask: Okay, I know how to deal with I/O and to write functions at this point, but how will I deal with graphic elements?  
So here it is the awaited, the one, the only...    

## The MiniLibx (or: *getting to know the graphic library*)  

## The Part You Play (or: *your code in the loop and.. the graphic elements per se*)  
**pun not intendend.. or is it?**
