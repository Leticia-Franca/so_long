This project is my first 2D game. It's supposed to be simple üòÅ (I'll have lots of chances to go crazy making games in the future, haha).  
The idea is really straightforward:  
- I'm displaying a map with some collectables and a character on the screen  
- The character must collect all the items before leaving the map  
  
Aside from the graphic elements management (which will be dealt with by the graphic library incorporated in the program), the code gravitates on aspects already acknowledged: **parsing, storing and validating**.    

## The MiniLibx (or: *getting to know the graphic library*)  

In summary, this library provides functions to open and manage windows, draw pixels, insert and destroy images and, of course, keep your program on a loop. Below, some useful links to practice and understand the MiniLibX better:
