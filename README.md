This is the project where you get in touch with the *graphic library*. Yey!  
Basically, So_Long is about you creating your first 2D game. It's supposed to be simple, though, so don't get worked up üòÅ (besides, you'll have lots of chances to go crazy making games in the future, if that's what you want haha).  
The idea is really straightforward:  
- You'll display a map with some collectables and a character on the screen  
- The character must collect all the items before leaving the map
